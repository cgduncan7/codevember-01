codevember 01 // 2018.11.01 // Infinity

30 days, 30 creative experiments.
CodeVember is a challenge for developers creating a creative sketch by day during the whole month of November.

## Description
Particles are generated on load with random colors in a palette which are in an *infinite* loop around the origin.
Uses the formula `(x,y) = (loopRadius * sin(t), loopRadius / 3.0 * sin(2t))` to create an âˆž looking-thing. :smile:
